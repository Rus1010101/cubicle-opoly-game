2. The Concept 💡
  "Cubicle-opoly" is a competitive board game that parodies the chaotic, unpredictable, and often absurd journey of a modern career. Designed for 2-4 players, the game utilises the familiar "roll and move" mechanic but replaces financial transactions with a single, more meaningful currency: "Insight Points" (IP).
  The game is a fast-paced, fun, and insightful digital experience, designed to be a powerful tool for team bonding and genuine conversation.
3. Your Objective 🏆  
  To have the most Insight Points (IP) when the first player completes two laps of the board. The winner is the player who has navigated their career with the most wisdom and growth, not necessarily the one who finished first.

5. The Board Layout: 28 Squares of Corporate Life
The digital board is a continuous loop designed for maximum interaction and fun.
The Four Corner Squares:
Corner 1: START / Performance Review 🏁: All players begin here. Each time a player passes this square (after their first lap), they gain +5 IP and the "Underdog Bonus."
Corner 2: Mandatory HR Training 😴: Any player landing here is "stuck in training" and must lose their next turn.
Corner 3: Team Offsite 🌴: A safe space. Nothing happens. The player can relax for a turn.
Corner 4: Re-Org Chaos! 🌪️: A major setback. The player landing here must lose 5 IP and is immediately moved to the "Mandatory HR Training" square.
The Spaces Between the Corners:
The 24 spaces between the corners are a dynamic mix of challenges and rewards. The board is now heavily focused on interaction, with 8 "Real Issue" squares and 8 "TBA Fun" squares distributed evenly around the board. These prompts are drawn randomly from a large pool, ensuring every game is a unique experience.
6. How to Play: A Turn in Detail
Roll & Move: On your turn, click the "Roll Die" button. Your pawn will move automatically.
Execute Square Action: A pop-up will appear with instructions. The game automatically handles all scoring and pawn movement.
The "Skip Task" Rule ⭐: The game has evolved! Unlike the original concept, you are not required to complete every task. If you land on a "Real Issue" or "TBA Fun" square and are not comfortable with the prompt, you can always select the "Skip Task" option for +0 IP. The goal is to have fun and share, not to feel pressured.
7. Winning the Game 🏅
The game ends immediately when the first player completes their second lap (by landing on or passing the "Performance Review" square for the second time). That player receives a +5 IP "Finisher's Bonus."
Then, all players count their total Insight Points. The player with the most IP is declared the winner, having proven they navigated the chaos of the corporate ladder with the most wisdom, vulnerability, and growth.
Optional House Rule: If the group is having fun and wants a longer game, a pop-up will appear when the game ends, allowing you to unanimously agree to play for more laps!
